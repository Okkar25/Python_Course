# Try solving these problems 

# Have Fun : ) 


# Problem 1: Sum of Natural Numbers
# Problem: Write a Python program to find the sum of the first n natural numbers using a while loop.

# Problem 2: Print "Python is Fun" 3 Times
# Problem: Write a Python program that uses a while loop to print "Python is Fun" three times.

# Problem 3: Print Even Numbers from 2 to 10
# Problem: Write a Python program that uses a while loop to print even numbers from 2 to 10.

# Problem 4: Countdown from 5 to 1
# Problem: Write a Python program that uses a while loop to print a countdown from 5 to 1. Please put countdown duration for 1 second between the reduced numbers. 
# ( Hint - Use time module )

# Problem 5: Sum of all odd numbers between two numbers
# Problem: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and calculate the sum of all odd numbers between those two input values.

# Problem 6: Guess the Number
# Problem: Write a Python program that repeatedly asks the user to guess a number until they guess correctly.
# ( Hint - Use random module )

# Problem 7: Factorial Calculation
# Problem: Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number using a while loop.
# ( Factorial => mathematical formula )
# ( For example => factorial of 3 = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 / factorial of 5 = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 )
